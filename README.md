# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied Correctly

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where classes are not applied correctly, despite restarting the development server and running a production build. The problem isn't directly related to syntax errors or simple typos but involves a more intricate issue that may stem from naming collisions, class order, or conflicts with other CSS.

## Problem Description

The issue isn't a simple case of mis-typed classes.  Even after verifying correct class names, and restarting the development server or build process, the Tailwind CSS styles are not rendered.

## Bug Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` (or appropriate start script)
4. Observe that Tailwind classes are not applied to the elements in the `bug.js` file.

## Potential Causes

* **Naming Conflicts:** Potential class name collisions with existing CSS rules or other frameworks.
* **Class Order:** The order in which Tailwind classes are applied may be interfering with the expected behavior.  
* **Plugin Conflicts:** If you are using plugins with Tailwind, there could be a conflict.
* **Build Process:** Something might be happening during the build process that removes or prevents the application of the Tailwind classes.
